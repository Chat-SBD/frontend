                Have you ever watched a video of yourself lifting and went damn, 
                I wish I had a terribly inaccurate AI to tell me whether 
                that was a good lift or not? Well now you have one!
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm just kidding, although the outcome of this website may not be what you expect looking
                at your lift, the process of creating this project was deeply insightful into the 
                realm of machine learning.

                <br>
                1) began with researching the different types of models, settled on mainly 2+1D and LSTM
                <br>
                2) wrote script scanning, chopping, and properly formatting youtube videos of meets for the 
                model to be trained on
                <br>
                3) set up parallel processing on cluster of computers to train the model
                <br>
                4) connected model to JavaScript and hosted it on this very website
                <br>
                yeah I'll turn this into paragraphs later
